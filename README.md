## A Neural Network built for the prediction of Molecular Energies

Uses a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV). AEVs provide the ability to
train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space. Through the application of AEVs, A model was developed which generates accurate predictions for the energies of organic compounds.
